# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project I tried to create a simple program that prints the multiplication tables for any number that is double by the value of any number entered

# What did you do particularly well?
I was able to learn how to output headers and design simple coding using count loop for the code.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
My code could be enhanced to a great outcome of basic multiplication. I could make the code more difficult for users with either a harder challenging approach or a much simpler method. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The hardest part of this code was to get the code to stop repeating the loop.  I could not figure out why it kept doing this, so google some help on how to stop loop from happening. I had to use the break and continue statement to finally get the code to stop looping.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I believe a lot of skills will carry over to help me understand and better myself to code more accurately. Learning different types of code-languages could be transferable to other courses I have in the future. This project could help me with future projects coming up.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Well maintainable means I can fix, add or take away anything to fit my needs. In coding the # symbol allows me to insert comments or to notify the user to address fixing.
